# Empty JavaScript template

Start a new [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) project quickly and easily in JavaScript (Node.js) with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for building an Actor with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)** - web scraping and browser automation library

## How it works

This template is useful when you're already familiar with the [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js) and [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) and want to start with a clean slate. It does not include `puppeteer` or `playwright` so install them manually and update the Dockerfile if you need them.

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-locally). To run the actor use the following command:

```bash
apify run
```

## Deploy to Apify

### Connect Git repository to Apify

If you've created a Git repository for the project, you can easily connect to Apify:

1. Go to [Actor creation page](https://console.apify.com/actors/new)
2. Click on **Link Git Repository** button

### Push project on your local machine to Apify

You can also deploy the project on your local machine to Apify without the need for the Git repository.

1. Log in to Apify. You will need to provide your [Apify API Token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) to complete this action.

    ```bash
    apify login
    ```

2. Deploy your Actor. This command will deploy and build the Actor on the Apify Platform. You can find your newly created Actor under [Actors -> My Actors](https://console.apify.com/actors?tab=my).

    ```bash
    apify push
    ```
